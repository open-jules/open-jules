# Open Jules: Your AI Coding Co-pilot ðŸš€

**Tired of the coding grind? Open Jules is here to help!**

Open Jules is a powerful multi-agent automation platform that uses AI agents to automate coding tasks, from planning to pull request creation. Built with React, Node.js, and Ollama.

## ðŸš€ New Features - Task Queue System

Open Jules now features a robust task queue system that allows you to:

- **Queue Multiple Tasks**: Add multiple tasks to a queue and execute them sequentially
- **Individual Task Control**: Pause, resume, cancel, or remove individual tasks
- **Real-time Monitoring**: View detailed logs and progress for each task in real-time
- **Task Persistence**: Tasks persist across application restarts
- **Queue Management**: Start, pause, and clear completed tasks from the queue
- **Individual Console Viewing**: Open detailed console views for each task with export functionality

## Who is Open Jules For?

Open Jules is a great fit for:

*   **Developers** looking to automate routine coding tasks and speed up their workflow.
*   **Teams** wanting to streamline their development process and integrate AI assistance.
*   **Open-source enthusiasts** eager to experiment with local AI models for code generation.
*   **Anyone curious about AI-powered development** who wants a hands-on tool to explore.

If you're comfortable with GitHub and running local applications, Open Jules can be a powerful addition to your toolkit!

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide

Get Open Jules up and running in a few steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   **Node.js:** Latest LTS version.

    *   In the UI, go to **Settings**:
        *   Enter your **GitHub Personal Access Token**.
        *   Assign the **Ollama models** you've pulled to the different AI agents (Planner, Developer, etc.).

4.  **Run Open Jules:**
